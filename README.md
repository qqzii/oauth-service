# oauth-service

## Project (oauth service with passport) for example and testing functionality

+ Laravel - v11.2.0
+ PHP - v8.2.17
+ Passport - v12.0
+ Fortify - v1.21

#### In order to test the Laravel Passport logic, you need to simultaneously deploy and run two projects

#### Also, to communicate with them, you either need to configure the web server correctly, or resort to the help of ngrok (I changed the domain for oauth-service - do not forget to update the paths in .env after that, both in this application and in the client)
